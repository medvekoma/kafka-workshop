Apache Kafka is an open-source
stream-processing software platform
developed by LinkedIn
and donated to the Apache Software Foundation,
written in Scala and Java.
The project aims to provide a unified,
high-throughput, low-latency platform
for handling real-time data feeds.
Kafka can connect to external systems
(for data import/export)
via Kafka Connect
and provides Kafka Streams,
a Java stream processing library.
